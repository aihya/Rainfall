1.	Program type:
	Running the command `file ./level8` we see the file is 32-bit ELF
	executable.
	Running the command `checksec --file ./level8, we see that the stack is
	executable (NX disabled).

2.	Content:
	There's two global variables ['service', 'auth'] and the function 'main',
	The main contains an infinite while loop, inside of it a buffer of size 
	128 bytes is filled using fgets, buffer is then compared with the
	string ['auth ', 'reset', 'service', 'login']. The first comparison results
	in a malloc(0x4) to the global variable auth, the second frees that 
	allocation, the fourth duplicates whatever comes after the string 'service'
	and in the scope of the last comparison there's a check for whether
	' auth + 0x20' is null or not, and spawns a shell with system(3) or write 
	the string "Password:\n"

3.	Solution:
	To solve this level we kust need to make sure the address in 'auth + 0x20'
	is filled with something.

	First we enter the string 'auth ' for give the gloval variable in address
	in memory, after that we enter the string 'service' followed with enough 
	bytes intill we reach the 'auth + 0x20' and then enter 'login', 
	automatically a shell will spawn.
