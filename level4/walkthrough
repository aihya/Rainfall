1.	Program type:
	Running the command `file ./level4` we see the file is 32-bit ELF
	executable.
	Running the command `checksec --file ./level4, we see that the stack is
	executable (NX disabled).

2.	Content:
	There's three functions ['main', 'n', 'p'].
	The content of the function 'n' is almost close to the previous level, the 
	difference being that instead of having the function printf(1) in the 
	function 'n' it's now in 'p', which makes it even further from the target
	buffer.
	There's a comparison between the value 0x1025544 (16930116 in decimal) and
	a global variable, and a system(3) call if they are equal.

3.	Solution:
	There's two problems in this case, the first is that the compared value 
	is big (in comparison to the previous level 0x40), and the second is that
	the call to printf(1) is far from the buffer.
	To solve the first problem we need to split the load of writting to the 
	stdout so that we don't have to write millions of bytes, so we will write 
	to the first left 2-bytes 258 bytes (0x102 in the compared value) and
	then write to the right 2-bytes 21828 bytes (0x5544 in the compared value).
