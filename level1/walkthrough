1.	Program type:
	Running the command `file ./level1` we see the file is 32-bit ELF
	executable.
	Running the command `checksec --file ./level1, we see that the stack is 
	executable (NX disabled).

2. Content:
	The command `objdump -M intel -d ./level1` shows extra function 'run'.
	When we examine the 'main' function we see that there's a call to only one
	function 'gets' which fills a buffer in 'main's stack frame and that's it, 
	no direct call to run.

	'run' in the otherhand has two function calls ['fwrite', 'system'],
	'fwrite' prints the string "Good... Wait what?\n" and 'system' calls 
	"/bin/sh".

3. Solution:
	The idea is to take advantage of the function 'gets' to further write on
	the stack and overwrite the eip of the 'main''s stack frame, so that when
	it reached the end, eip register will contain the address of the function
	'run'
