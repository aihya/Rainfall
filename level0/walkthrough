1.	Program type:
	Running the command `file ./level0` we see the file is 32-bit ELF 
	executable. 

2.	Content:
	There's two functions [setresgid, setresuid] in the main that are used to
	access the "/bin/sh" file with the previliges of the binary owner, which 
	is used as parameter in execv (thats the goal).
	But this is pretty much unnecessary, the reason being that binary is 
	already a 'Set-UID' executable, which means all the files accessed with
	such binary are accessed with the previliges of the ower of the binary, in
	this case `execv("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh")`
