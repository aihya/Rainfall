1.	Program type:
	Running the command `file ./level0` we see the file is 32-bit ELF 
	executable. 

2.	Content:
	First, atoi(3) is used to convert the first argument passed to the main,
	and the latter is compared with the value 0x1a7 (423 in decimal). The 
	program prints the message "No !" and stops if they are not equal, 
	and continues otherwise.

	There's two functions [setresgid, setresuid] in the main that are used to
	access the "/bin/sh" file with the previliges of the binary owner, which 
	is used as parameter in execv (thats the goal).
	
	But this is pretty much unnecessary, the reason being that binary is 
	already a 'Set-UID' executable, which means all the files accessed with
	such binary are accessed with the previliges of the ower of the binary, in
	this case `execv("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh")`

3.	Solution:
	Nothing fancy, becasue there's a simple comparison we just need to pass the
	argument "423" to the binary and a shell will pop up.
